# Customer Portal Web App

## Introduction
This is a customer portal app for a fictitious company. The idea for the app came from my experience with many electricity and insurance provider companies here in Germany that lack a unified web portal for their customers to view/manage their contracts, request/receive support, update/manage relevant data, ... . So, I decided to develop one. Hopefully, by the end of this project, one or two of these companies would actually use this portal to make their customers interactions with them a bit easier.
